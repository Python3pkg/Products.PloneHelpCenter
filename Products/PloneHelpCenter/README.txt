Overview
========

Plone Help Center is an application designed to aid the documentation of
Plone, and is used on plone.org to categorize and keep documentation up to
date. It should be usable for documenting other open source products
(such as Plone Product add-ons) or even for other documentation projects.

Usage
=====

Plone Help Center has inline documentation, just add a help center.

Upgrades
========

If you are upgrading a Plone site with an existing help center from a
version prior to 3.0, you *must* run the upgrade profile. In the ZMI,
go to portal_setup and use the upgrades tab.
