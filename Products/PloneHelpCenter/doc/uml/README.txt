INTRODUCTION

These UML Diagrams were constructed in an attempt
to better understand the structure of PloneHelpCenter.

There is NO GUARANTEE that these diagrams accurately
represent the actual code.  The diagrams are also not 
complete (for example, to recreate the product with 
ArchGenXML) - but they could be made complete with some work,
